# Example morloc programs

The [morloc](https://github.com/morloc-project/morloc) language is designed to
support the logical design of libraries and programs from composed of functions
from many languages. This repo contains examples of how this can work in
practice. More will examples will be added in the future.

Details on each example are present in the example-specific READMEs. Here is a
high-level overview of each:

 * `workflow-comparisons/flu-case-study` - a comparison of 6 bioinformatics
   workflow strategies (bash, python, nextflow, snakemake, and hybrid) that is
   associated with a paper (in review) 

 * `workflow-comparisons/tiny-example` - a very minimal comparison of morloc to snakemake and nextflow
