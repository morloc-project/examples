# Example morloc programs

The [morloc](https://github.com/morloc-project/morloc) language is designed to
support the design of polyglot libraries and programs. This repo contains
examples of how this can work in practice.

Details on each example are present in the example-specific READMEs. Here is a
high-level overview of each:

 * `workflow-comparisons/flu-case-study` - a comparison of 6 bioinformatics
   workflow strategies (bash, python, nextflow, snakemake, and hybrid) that are
   associated with the first morloc paper (in review)

 * `workflow-comparisons/tiny-example` - a very minimal comparison of morloc to
   snakemake and nextflow, also associated with the morloc paper.

 * `fasta` - an example of a morloc program that operates of FASTA-formatted data
