# Example morloc programs

The [morloc](https://github.com/morloc-project/morloc) language is designed to
support the design of polyglot libraries and programs. This repo contains
examples of how this can work in practice.

Details on each example are present in the example-specific READMEs. Here is a
high-level overview of each:

 * `fasta` - an example of a morloc program that operates of FASTA-formatted data

 * `workflow-comparisons/flu-case-study` - a comparison of 6 bioinformatics
   workflow strategies (bash, python, nextflow, snakemake, and hybrid) that is
   associated with a paper (in review)

 * `workflow-comparisons/tiny-example` - a very minimal comparison of morloc to snakemake and nextflow
