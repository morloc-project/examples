# Comparison of morloc versus other approaches

## Setup

Create a Docker image that contains everything needed to run all of the comparisons (morloc, pybind11 for Python/C++ interop, nextflow, snakemake, etc)

```
sudo make build
```

Enter the container shell:

```
sudo make shell
```

This mounts the current working directory into the container as a virtual
volume. This means that from within the container you may alter this folder and
the changes will persist on your machine, but no other changes (installed
programs, for instance) will be visible.

Inside the shell, you need to build the tree and retrieveFlu modules:

```
pip install modules/rooted_tree
pip install apps/retrieveFlu
```

Then go to case_python and run pybase.py

```
python3 pybase.py
```

This should create a tree file
